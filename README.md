Intro to Python and GitHub

Description

For this assignment, we are getting used to the basics in python and learning how to use GitHub. The assignment includes creating an array in python and printing out a matrix using that array. For the first part, if i = j, you print 1, if not you print 0. For the next matrix, if i = j, you print 1, if not add 3 everywhere that it doesn't equal j. For the last matrix, you are doing the same thing as the second matrix, just deleting the last column of the matrix.

Installation
__init__.py: In this, import any needed packages. For this assignment you will need: 'import numpy as np'

requirements.txt: create a file in your explorer in codespace and name it 'requirements.txt'. In this file, you should type 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' into the terminal to install numpy.
After your code is typed you can run it by either hitting the run button or clicking the triangle by where your files are.
