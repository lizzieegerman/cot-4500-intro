print("For this assignment, we are getting used to the basics in python and learning how to use GitHub. The assignment includes creating an array in python and printing out a matrix using that array. For the first part, if i = j, you print 1, if not you print 0. For the next matrix, if i = j, you print 1, if not add 3 everywhere that it doesn't equal j. For the last matrix, you are doing the same thing as the second matrix, just deleting the last column of the matrix.")
